#Certainly, I'd be happy to explain the code you've provided in detail!

```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfWriter, PdfReader
```
In this line, you're importing the necessary classes `PdfWriter` and `PdfReader` from the `PyPDF2` library. These classes allow you to work with PDF files in Python.

```python
num = int(input("Enter page number you want combine from multiple documents "))
```
This line prompts the user to enter a page number. The value entered by the user will be stored in the variable `num` after being converted to an integer using `int()`.

```python
pdf1 = open('aiml.pdf', 'rb')
pdf2 = open('OfferLetter.pdf', 'rb')
```
Here, the code is opening two PDF files in binary read mode (`'rb'`). The first file, `'aiml.pdf'`, and the second file, `'OfferLetter.pdf'`, are being opened. These PDF files are expected to be in the same directory as the script.

```python
pdf_writer = PdfWriter()
```
A `PdfWriter` object is created. This object will be used to write the combined pages into a new PDF file.

```python
pdf1_reader = PdfReader(pdf1)
page = pdf1_reader.pages[num - 1]
pdf_writer.add_page(page)
```
A `PdfReader` object is created for the first PDF file (`'aiml.pdf'`). Then, the code extracts the page specified by the user (`num - 1` because page numbering is zero-based) using the `pages` attribute of the `PdfReader` object. The extracted page is added to the `pdf_writer` object using the `add_page()` method. This process is repeated for the second PDF file as well.

```python
pdf2_reader = PdfReader(pdf2)
page = pdf2_reader.pages[num - 1]
pdf_writer.add_page(page)
```
This code block is similar to the previous one, but it deals with the second PDF file (`'OfferLetter.pdf'`).

```python
with open('output.pdf', 'wb') as output:
    pdf_writer.write(output)
```
Finally, a new PDF file named `'output.pdf'` is created in binary write mode (`'wb'`). The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after writing. The `pdf_writer` object's `write()` method is used to write the combined pages to the new PDF file.

To summarize, this code takes two PDF files (`'aiml.pdf'` and `'OfferLetter.pdf'`), extracts the specified page number from each file (as specified by the user), and combines these pages into a new PDF file named `'output.pdf'`. This new PDF file will contain the selected pages from the two input PDFs.
