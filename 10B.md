These lines are comments that provide information about the code. The first line `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` specifies the character encoding of the source code file, which is UTF-8 in this case. The subsequent lines indicate that the code was created on August 29, 2023, and the author is identified as "ASUS".

```python
import json
```
This line imports the `json` module, which provides functions to work with JSON data (JavaScript Object Notation).

```python
with open('weather_data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```
Here, the code opens a JSON file named `'weather_data.json'` using a `with` statement. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after it's used. The content of the file is loaded using `json.load()` and stored in the variable `data`.

```python
current_temp = data['main']['temp']
humidity = data['main']['humidity']
weather_desc = data['weather'][0]['description']
```
These lines extract specific pieces of information from the JSON data that was loaded. It assumes that the JSON data has a structure where `'main'` contains temperature and humidity information, and `'weather'` is an array containing weather description data. `current_temp` stores the current temperature, `humidity` stores the humidity percentage, and `weather_desc` stores the weather description.

```python
print(f"Current temperature: {current_temp}Â°C")
print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
print(f"Weather description: {weather_desc}")
```
These `print` statements display the extracted weather data. It uses f-strings (formatted strings) to incorporate the variables `current_temp`, `humidity`, and `weather_desc` into the output.

In summary, this code reads weather data from a JSON file, extracts specific information about the current temperature, humidity, and weather description, and then prints out these details with appropriate labels. It's a simple example of how JSON data can be loaded, parsed, and used in a Python script.
