```python
import requests
import os
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
- `import requests`: This imports the `requests` library, which is used to make HTTP requests to web pages.
- `import os`: This imports the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as creating directories and working with file paths.
- `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`: This imports the `BeautifulSoup` class from the `bs4` library, which is used to parse and navigate HTML and XML documents.

```python
url = 'https://xkcd.com/1/'
```
- This line sets the starting URL for the first XKCD comic.

```python
if not os.path.exists('xkcd_comics'):
    os.makedirs('xkcd_comics')
```
- This code block checks if a folder named 'xkcd_comics' exists in the current directory. If it doesn't exist, the script creates the folder using the `os.makedirs` function. This folder will be used to store the downloaded comic images.

```python
while True:
```
- This starts an infinite loop, which will continue until a `break` statement is encountered.

```python
res = requests.get(url)
res.raise_for_status()
```
- These lines use the `requests.get()` function to send an HTTP GET request to the URL specified by the `url` variable. The response is stored in the `res` variable. The `res.raise_for_status()` line checks if the response status code indicates success (HTTP status code 200). If there's an error, this line will raise an exception.

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')
```
- This line creates a `BeautifulSoup` object named `soup` by parsing the HTML content of the response stored in `res.text`. The `'html.parser'` argument specifies the parser to be used for parsing the HTML content.

```python
comic_elem = soup.select('#comic img')
```
- This line uses the `soup.select()` method to find all `<img>` elements within an element with the id "comic". The result is stored in the `comic_elem` list.

```python
if comic_elem == []:
    print('Could not find comic image.')
```
- This block checks if the `comic_elem` list is empty, which would mean that the comic image was not found on the current page. If it's empty, a message is printed indicating that the comic image could not be found.

```python
else:
    comic_url = 'https:' + comic_elem[0].get('src')
```
- If the `comic_elem` list is not empty, this line extracts the 'src' attribute value from the first element of the list. This attribute contains the URL of the comic image.

```python
print(f'Downloading {comic_url}...')
```
- This line prints a message indicating that the script is about to download the comic image from the URL.

```python
res = requests.get(comic_url)
res.raise_for_status()
```
- These lines send an HTTP GET request to the `comic_url` to download the comic image. Just like before, `res.raise_for_status()` is used to check if the download was successful.

```python
image_file = open(os.path.join('xkcd_comics', os.path.basename(comic_url)), 'wb')
```
- This line opens a new binary file for writing with the file path based on the comic URL. The `os.path.join()` function is used to create the file path, and `os.path.basename()` extracts the filename from the URL. The `'wb'` mode indicates that the file is opened in binary write mode.

```python
for chunk in res.iter_content(100000):
    image_file.write(chunk)
image_file.close()
```
- This loop iterates through the content of the comic image's HTTP response in chunks of 100,000 bytes. It writes each chunk to the `image_file` using the `write()` method. After downloading and writing all the chunks, the `image_file` is closed.

```python
prev_link = soup.select('a[rel="prev"]')[0]
if not prev_link:
    break
url = 'https://xkcd.com' + prev_link.get('href')
```
- These lines find the `<a>` element with the attribute `rel="prev"` which contains the link to the previous comic. It extracts the `href` attribute value, which represents the URL of the previous comic. The script then updates the `url` variable to the URL of the previous comic, allowing the loop to continue downloading the comics sequentially.

```python
print('All comics downloaded.')
```
- After the loop completes, this line is executed, indicating that all the comics have been successfully downloaded.

This script essentially scrapes the XKCD website for comic images, downloads them, and saves them to a local folder. However, keep in mind that web scraping might be subject to the terms of use of a website, and it's important to respect those terms and not overload the server with too many requests.
